## Setup ##
# All joints go from -120 to 120 degrees
# Corresponding to a pulse width of 0 to 1000 ms
# Pulse commands are in units of ms

# List of joint (id, command) pairs
targets = [(1, 500), # SHOULDER ROTATION
           (2, 750), # SHOULDER HINGE -- KEEP JOINT 2 BETWEEN 125 AND 775
           (3, 40), # ELBOW HINGE
           (4, 350), # WRIST HINGE
           (5, 500), # WRIST ROTATION
           (10, 350)] # Gripper joint. Keep below 650

duration = 1.0 # Time to complete motion

# joint id, pulling from targets/duration above

# Send commands through your topic for each
# joint id, using targets, duration above

# TODO: Update to your ForwardMsg type

# xyz, roll, and pitch

# TODO: Update to your InverseMsg type
# from rosbot_msgs.msg import InverseMsg

# End position of arm relative to base_link
xyz = [0.18, 0.02, 0.32]
